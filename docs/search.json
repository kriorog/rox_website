    "text": "Prelude\nThe title of this post is a play on the title of a Porcupine Tree song from their 2004 album Deadwing. I recommend listening to the song while you read.\n\nI intend for this post to provide a roadmap or a guide for what I foresee with this website and its future content, mainly for myself. I don’t want to lay down any rules for what will be covered and what not, rather to put down my initial vision on the record.\nMy primary reason for setting up this website is to avoid skill atrophy. These skills are ones that I have worked hard to acquire and hate to see them wither away. Unfortunately some atrophy has already set in, so I’ll have to begin with revisiting some fundamentals before going further, i.e. a restart.\nA common problem post-graduation is the realization that the world doesn’t have the need for the particular set of skills or interest that one has. Or, perhaps more appropriately, it is unlikely to find oneself in circumstances where that is the case. That does not mean it is not possible, but unlikely. A perfect circumstance does not exist…or does it? Sounds philosophical.\nMathematics focuses in part on such questions, i.e. the existence of solutions without explicitly finding them. Just showing that a solution exists is generally a good first step in one’s quest for solutions, and often simpler but not always. If no solution exists, then don’t waste your time searching for one. For the time being, I’ll stick with the existence of the perfect circumstance being unlikley, without further quantification…then again what is “perfect”?\nBut…it seems like we are dealing with a finite set of perfect circumstances \\(S\\) in a countably infinite set \\(\\Omega\\) of all possible circumstances. \\(S\\) is assumed to be finite considering it contains defined circumstances, based on preferences and a specific set of criteria.\nThe probability \\(P(S)\\) finding oneself in a “perfect” circumstance in \\(S\\) from \\(\\Omega\\) is \\[P(S) = \\frac{|S|}{|\\Omega|}.\\] where \\(|\\cdot|\\) is the set cardinality, i.e. the number of elements in the set. One can see the result here, or the problem in the statement. The cardinality of \\(\\Omega\\) is not defined as the set is infinite, so the above probability is arithmetically invalid. Therefore, the appropriately rigorous approach is to evaluate the probability \\(P(S)\\) in the limit as the cardinality of \\(\\Omega\\) approaches infinity\n\\[\\lim_{|\\Omega| \\to \\infty} P(S) = \\lim_{|\\Omega| \\to \\infty} \\frac{|S|}{|\\Omega|} = 0.\\]\nIn other words, it is improbable to draw at random a perfect circumstance from the set of inifnitely many possible circumstances. This is not very uplifting. The key here is that it is improbable to find oneself in the perfect circumstances, not impossible. The first draw might be perfect, but I would not bet on it.\nAlso, one does not get one draw in life, there may be successive draws. One could then consider the distribution of \\(k\\) successful draws from total \\(N\\) draws following a \\(binomial\\) distribution \\[P(k) =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nN\\\\\nk\n\\end{pmatrix}\nP(S)^k(1-P(S))^{N-k}.\n\\] This approach is uttely pointless since \\(P(S)=0\\), thus \\(P(k)=0\\) for any \\(k \\leq N\\). Again, rather depressing. No matter how often you try, achieveing a perfect circumstance at least once is improbable.\nHere I’ve not shown the perfect circumstance(s) not to exist, just that it is improbable to find oneself in it. They may be somewhere in \\(\\Omega\\), just drowned out by all things imperfect.\nThis reasoning has its flaws.It is not intended to be complete, but descriptive. Of course, one does not draw directly from the global \\(\\Omega\\). Rather, one draws from a potentially finite subset \\(\\omega \\subseteq \\Omega\\), whose elements are dependent on various factors, such a geographic location or other real world constraints. Still though, one does not control what elements are in \\(\\omega\\), so they are as good as randomly drawn from \\(\\Omega\\). So obtaining an \\(\\omega\\) with \\(N\\) elements with at least one perfect circumstance is akin to the binomial approach above for \\(k=1\\), which has zero probability.\nAnother potential flaw is that I’m focusing on perfect circumstances. That may not be a flaw per se, since I’ve reasoned that finding oneself in such circumstance is highly improbable. I could relax the definintion of the set \\(S\\) to include all acceptable circumstances not only those that are perfect, calling that set \\(S'\\). Is \\(S'\\) finite or infinite? What makes circumstances acceptable? This is quite subjective, and as such may yield \\(S'\\) having to be considered as being countably infinite.\nSo what is \\(P(S')\\)? We can approach it in the same way as before\n\\[\\lim_{|\\Omega|, |S'| \\to \\infty} P(S') = \\lim_{|\\Omega|, |S'| \\to \\infty} \\frac{|S'|}{|\\Omega|} = 0.\\] I justify this result with L’Hopital’s rule, considering the rate of change in \\(|S'|\\) being much less than the change in \\(|\\Omega|\\) as they both tend to infinity. I think this makes sense, since \\(S' \\subseteq \\Omega\\) with a much stricter admission criteria. However, one can adjust the definition of being acceptable to be close to everything, i.e. \\(S' \\to \\Omega\\), making \\(P(S')\\) approach unity, but I exclude such scenarios. Acceptable should deviate only marginally from perfect.\nSo, regardless of circumstances being perfect or acceptable, finding oneself in either is still improbable, though neither is impossible.\n\n\nThe vision"

    "text": "In Part 1 of this series - the fundamental requirements and building blocks of aircraft weight & balance were introduced.\nThe key take-away was that weight and balance is a key element in aviation safety.\nThe establishment of weight and balance as a matter of safety only focused on the aircraft’s weight and Center of Gravity (CG) being inside the weight and balance envelope.\nThis is a binary requirement, i.e. either it is inside the envelope or outside. No consideration was made to where inside the envelope the aircraft CG was, as that was not a concern for safety.\nIn this Part 2 of the series - we’ll investigate how CG certain locations inside the envelope are better than others and how an aircraft’s weight and balance affects operational efficiency."

    "text": "Certain CG locations are better than others\nCG locations further aft along the aircraft fuselage are better.\nQuestion: In what sense are aft CG locations better?\nAnswer: Aft CG reduces the aircraft’s aerodynamic drag, which then reduces the required thrust from the engine, which saves fuel.\nTo explain why this is the case, we need some physics and math. If that is not your forte, then please follow along regardless, as there is commentary provided along the way.\n\nThe mathMore lift, more dragTying it all together\n\n\nConsider a transport aircraft with weight \\(W\\) in steady and level flight at an angle of attack \\(\\alpha\\) relative to the oncoming airflow. The below figure shows such an aircraft and the forces acting on it due to the wings and tail, and due to its own weight. For our demonstration, we only need to consider those forces.\n\n\n\nA typical transport aircraft in steady flight.\n\n\nThe lift \\(L_w\\) and moment \\(M_w\\) from the wing are applied at the same point - the aerodynamic center of the wing. Similarly, the lift \\(L_t\\) and moment \\(M_t\\)of the tail are calculated at the aerodynamic center of the tail.\nThe aerodynamic center of a lifting surface is a point of convenience. The convenience associated with this point is that the moment \\(M\\) becomes independent of the angle of attack \\(\\alpha\\). Therefore, in our model, both \\(M_w\\) and \\(M_t\\) are constants with respect to \\(\\alpha\\).\nThe aerodynamic centers of the wing and tail are fixed points on the aircraft geometry, therefore we can define the distances \\(s_w\\) and \\(s_t\\), which represent the distance between the CG and the aerodynamic centers of the wing and tail respectively.\nSince the aerodynamic centers are fixed, the distance between them is also fixed. Therefore, we can also define their fixed spacing \\(s = s_t-s_w\\).\nFor steady state to prevail - the aircraft must be in both a force and moment equilibrium around its CG. To establish this, the sum of all forces and moments, separately, must vanish (i.e. be zero).\nFirst, let’s look at the forces: \\[\\begin{align}\n    \\sum_{\\text{around CG}} \\text{Forces} &= L_w - L_t -W = 0 \\Rightarrow \\boxed{W = L_w - L_t}\\\\\n\\end{align}\\]\nThis tells us that the total lift of the aircraft, i.e. the sum of lift from wing and tail, must be equal to the aircraft’s weight. The boxed relation will be used later on.\nNext, let’s look at the moments (around the CG): \\[\\begin{align}\n    \\sum_{\\text{around CG}} \\text{Moments}   &= L_w s_w - L_t s_t + M_w - M_t = 0\\\\\n    \\Rightarrow L_w &= \\frac{L_t s_t - M_w + M_t}{s_w}\\\\\n\\end{align}\\] Here, we have re-arranged the terms of the moment equilibrium criteria and isolated the lift of the wing \\(L_w\\).\nWe can now use the boxed result from the force equilibrium above and replace \\(L_t\\) with the relation \\(L_t = L_w - W\\). This gives us \\[\\begin{align}\n  L_w &= \\frac{(L_w-W)s_t - M_w + M_t}{s_w}\\\\\n  \\Rightarrow L_w\\left(1 - \\frac{s_t}{s_w}\\right) &= \\frac{M_t - M_w - Ws_t}{s_w}\\\\\n  \\Rightarrow L_w &= \\frac{M_t - M_w - W s_t}{s_w-s_t}\n\\end{align}\\] Remembering that \\(s = s_t-s_w\\) and thus \\(-s = s_w-s_t\\), we obtain \\[\\begin{align}\n  L_w &= \\frac{W(s_w+s) - M_t - M_w}{s}\n\\end{align}\\]\nHere we have derived a relationship between the wing’s lift \\(L_w\\) and the CG logation relative to the wing through \\(s_w\\). Other parameters are constants.\nWhat is interesting to investigate, is how \\(L_w\\) changes if the CG is moved, i.e. if \\(s_w\\) changes.\nMathematically, we do this by checking the derivative \\(\\frac{dL_w}{ds_t}\\), which is \\[\\frac{dL_w}{ds_w} = \\frac{W}{s} &gt; 0\\] which is positive and constant at given weight \\(W\\).\nFor a finite change in the CG location \\(\\Delta s_w\\) we can then determine the associated change in the wing’s lift \\(\\Delta L_w\\) as \\[\\Delta L_w = \\frac{W}{s}\\Delta s_w\\]\nRight…what does this tell us?\n\nIf we move the CG forward, then \\(\\Delta s_w\\) is positive as the distance between the CG and the wing’s aerodynamic center increases. This makes \\(\\Delta L_w\\) positive, i.e. the lift increases.\nIf we move the CG aft, then \\(\\Delta s_w\\) is negative, and \\(\\Delta L_w\\) is also negative, i.e. the lift decreases.\n\nTherefore, a more forward CG location requires the wing to generate more lift.\n\n\nWe have established that a more forward CG requires more lift from the wing.\nThe fuel burn of an aircraft is determined by the required thrust \\(T\\) from the engines. For steady flight, the thrust \\(T\\) must be equal to the drag \\(D\\).\nThe total drag of an aircraft in steady flight can be modelled with its drag polar as \\[D = qS_w\\left(C_{D0} + k_wC_{Lw}^2 + k_t\\frac{S_t}{S_w}C_{Lt}^2\\right)\\] where:\n\n\\(C_{D0}\\) is the zero-lift drag of the aircraft.\n\\(k_w C_{Lw}^2\\) and \\(k_t\\frac{S_t}{S_w}C_{Lt}^2\\) are the lift-induced drag components of the wing and tail respectively.\n\\(k_w\\) and \\(k_t\\) are efficiency factors of the wing and tail lifting surfaces respectively.\n\\(C_{Lw}\\) and \\(C_{Lt}\\) are the lift-coefficients of the wing and tail respectively.\n\\(S_w\\) and \\(S_t\\) are the reference surface areas of the wing and tail respectively.\n\\(q\\) is dynamic pressure.\n\nAs the wing is a much larger lifting surface than the tail, its contribution to lift-induced drag is also much larger. Therefore, the drag polar can be simplified, without loss of generality, to \\[ D = qS_w \\left(C_{D0} + k_w C_{Lw}^2 \\right) \\] This is also the reason we focued on \\(L_w\\) in the previous section.\nThe wing lift from before, \\(L_w\\), can be written as \\[ L_w = qS_{w}C_{Lw} \\]\nSo, at constant dynamic pressure \\(q\\) (i.e. fixed altitude and speed), more lift \\(L_w\\) is requires a larger \\(C_{Lw}\\) (i.e. a higher angle of attack \\(\\alpha\\)).\nWe are now interested in the change in drag with lift, i.e. the derivative \\(\\frac{dD}{dC_{Lw}}\\).\nTaking the derivative of the simplified drag polar with respect the \\(C_{Lw}\\) we obtain \\[\\frac{dD}{dC_{Lw}} = \\left(\\frac{2k_w}{qS_w}\\right)C_{Lw}\\] where the bracketed term is always positive and \\(C_{Lw}&gt;0\\) for positive lift.\nTherefore, a finite increase in the wing lift through the lift coefficient \\(\\Delta C_{Lw}\\) yields a finite change in drag \\(\\Delta D\\)\n\\[\\Delta D = \\left(\\frac{2k_w}{qS_w}C_{Lw}\\right) \\Delta C_{Lw}\\]\nFor an increase in lift, i.e. \\(\\Delta C_{Lw} &gt; 0\\), then \\(\\Delta D &gt;0\\) representing an increase in drag.\n\n\nAt last, we have shown that a more forward CG requires more lift from the aircraft’s wing.\nWe have also shown that a higher lift from the wing results in higher drag on the aircraft, as it causes higher lift-induced drag.\nThe higher drag will require higher thrust from the engines to maintain steady flight.\nConsequently, higher thrust requires more fuel burn."
